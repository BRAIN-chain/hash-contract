I've been told by an auditioner that this is the most difficult part of the audition process for him. The other advice I would give here is to treat yourself the way you would want to be treated. If you feel nervous or intimidated, don't allow it to dictate your actions. Go in and do your best, no matter how bad it is. If it improves, great. If it doesn't, don't get too down on yourself. I have a friend who, if her first audition didn't go well, would get in her car and drive off crying. You can imagine how that would end up for her on the side of the highway or in a ditch.",

I love philosophy. It's not a subject that I expect anyone to know about, so seeing philosophy expressed in other ways is very attractive. Many artists have studied it. The catalogue has drawings, paintings, and other types of work, so you can see what the artist thinks about these ideas. You can even find images from some of his films. I'm sure you will enjoy the exhibition. It's in the hall where the lectures are usually held in the University. Can I give you a few more tips for the catalogue? It's got some nice pictures and words, but they are not in English. They are in French. Amelia has translated some of the text. Take a look at it. It's a bit different from the typical philosophy book. It has some sections about the artist's life and philosophy, and a bit about art in general. It's an unusual, but very interesting, book.
